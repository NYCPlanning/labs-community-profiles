    <p>Community boards create opportunities for active, local participation in public decision making processes. They articulate community needs; inform services provided; and reflect New York City’s remarkable diversity. Community districts range in size from less than 900 acres to almost 15,000 acres, and in population from a little more than 50,000 residents to more than&nbsp;200,000.</p>
