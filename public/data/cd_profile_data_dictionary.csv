poverty_rate,"The NYCgov poverty rate, which is a poverty measurement specific to New York City. The NYCgov poverty threshold is based on national expenditures on food, clothing, shelter and utilities adjusted for the high cost of housing in New York City. The income side of the measure includes the value of anti-poverty programs such as SNAP, housing assistance, and the earned income tax credit among others as family resources while accounting for medical spending and the costs of commuting and childcare for workers. The NYCgov poverty measure is a historically higher, but more realistic, measure of poverty than the official U.S. measure. That measure does not account for local costs of living, or the value of most anti-poverty benefits.
